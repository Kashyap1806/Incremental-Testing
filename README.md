# Incremental-Testing
Geo-Lift Incrementality Test: Measure the true causal impact of ad spend using a Difference-in-Differences design. Simulates geo-level data, computes pre/post revenue deltas, runs a DiD regression with cluster-robust errors, and calculates percent lift. Swap in your own data to reveal real incremental ROI.
